# Requests to test our API routes easily (without a frontend)

# In order to use this file => install VsCode extension "REST Client" from "Huachao Mao"
# Start your backend
# You should see a link "Send Request" popping up above each request

# Testing routes using a requests file like this is recommend to test
# the functionality of the backend FIRST, before connecting a frontend and debugging issues 
# with the backend from the frontend, which is way more difficult
