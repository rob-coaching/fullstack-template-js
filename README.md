# Fullstack MERN template

This template gives you some boilerplate for an already integrated frontend backend template
with an fully integrated signup, login & logout flow.

Demo:

## Auth info 

For the authentication JWT is used and HTTP headers for exchange of the token. 
That prevents the usage of login cookies between frontend and backend which are likely get blocked
by browsers if frontend & backend are deployed to separate domains.
